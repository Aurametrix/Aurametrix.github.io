In the FV&amp;B cohort that required ICU-level care (n=11), 7 (63.6%) were male with a median age of 71 (66.5, 
76.5). 5 (45.5%) were vaccinated with three consecutive Pfizer immunizations, 4 (36.4%) received three doses 
of the Moderna vaccine, and 2 (18.2%) received two Janssen vaccines. 4 (36.4%) died, 3 (27.2%) were discharged to a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), and 2 (18.2%) were discharged home.</span></span></p>

Worried about body odor?
You are not alone. According to pre-COVID surveys, over one third said the fear of smelling unpleasant left them feeling unhappy and unattractive. Many people who survived COVID-19 worry about their body odor getting worse post-infection.

Lipids play a crucial role throughout the viral life cycle, and viruses are known to exploit lipid pathways to affect host metabolism. Numerous observational studies have shown potential beneficial effects of lipid-lowering treatment on the course of COVID-19 with significant improved prognosis and reduced mortality. On the other hand, bioactive lipids have been proposed as potential drugs helping to combat COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>

</div><div>Glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids  are markers of severe COVID-19,  increased in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Lipid storm can be self-destructive enhancing peptide-mediated cytokine storms. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism 
may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19.&nbsp;</div>

Genetic evolution happens because mutations - wrong building blocks of DNA - are randomly introduced during the copying and repair of genetic material. Not all mutations are meaningful, but those that affect cellular processes or lead to amino acid changes, can change the organism’s fitness - the ability to replicate and transmit and strive in different environments. Evolution can also happen through recombination. It is much faster than one nucleotide at a time and&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #fcfcfc; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 18px; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;">the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - first identified in 2019 - is especially 

good in using this&nbsp;mechanism.&nbsp;
