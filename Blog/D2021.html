<span style="font-family: inherit;">Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) enzyme is a seemingly insignificant enzyme that normally converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine (TMA) into a neutral trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). 

The amounts of this highly-specialized detoxifying enzyme are highly variable. It depends on the age, 

sex hormones, infections (estradiol and testosterone, hepatitis virus have been found to reduce FMO3 capacity), 

obesity traits and diseases such as diabetes. The difference can be up to 20-fold between individuals. Mutations in the FMO3 gene cause low metabolic capacity associated with the disorder trimethylaminuria (TMAU) that attracts little biomedical interest.&nbsp; This condition, however, might matter more than it seems.</span><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://aurametrix.com/images/Studies/COVID/Covid-19-shield.jpg" style="clear: right; display: block; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">

<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Could there be a link between FMO3 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination?&nbsp;</span><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Individuals differ in their susceptibility to viral infections and genes contribute to the risk score. Less than 10% of humans infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop TB, partially because of polymorphism in Tyrosine kinase (TYK2, P1104A) also responsible for severe COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, it was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the ACE2 receptor for cell entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming. ACE2 expression, indeed, influences COVID-19 risk and a rare variant located close to this gene was found to confer protection against COVID-19, possibly by decreasing ACE2 expression. Interestingly, FMO3 is one of the few genes with expression correlated to ACE2 [Sungnak et al, 2020] along with genes associated with immune
functions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Coronavirus disease is associated with increased risk of thrombotic events. According to recent research, low levels of FMO3 protect against thrombosis [Shih et al, 2019] while some FMO3 mutations confer higher risk [Oliveira-Filho et al, 2021]. FMO3 rs1736557 might increase the anti‐platelet efficacy of clopidogrel [Zhu et al, 2021]. Genetic risk can be mediated by gut microbiota [Gabashvili, 2020]. There are also associations with other diseases such as diabetes, renal and cardiovascular conditions increasing risk of severe COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Studying trimethylaminuria-like conditions might help in developing strategies for prevention and therapy of other diseases, including COVID-19.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Our COVID-19 disease and vaccines study [<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04832932">NCT04832932</a>, Gabashvili, 2021] compares side-effects of vaccines and clinical course of infections (including vaccine breakthroughs) in several cohorts including MEBO and TMAU.

 On 26 November 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron. 
 It is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. 
 But many important questions about this variant's severity remain unanswered.

 Omicron has more than 30 mutations in the spike protein targeted by COVID-19 vaccines. H655Y (Histidine at position 655 substituted by Tyrosine; first detected in Brazil) was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. 
 Another mutation borrowed from Gamma variant, N679K, may also increase infectivity.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: times;"><span><span style="background-color: white;">Environmental factors contribute to the spread of microorganisms causing diseases.

A team of scientists from Northeast US analyzed COVID-19 cases from 2669 counties&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">and found that cold and dry weather and low levels of ultraviolet radiation are moderately associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, with humidity playing the largest role.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; letter-spacing: -0.01em; word-spacing: 0.05em;">17.5% of the virus’ reproductive number was attributable to meteorological factors, with temperature accounted for 3.73%, humidity accounted for 9.35%, and UV radiation for 4.44%.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: times;"><span style="background-color: white; letter-spacing: -0.01em; word-spacing: 0.05em;">This is in line with earlier&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: times;">findings about SARS-CoV-2 being less stable at higher humidity and warmer temperatures in human nasal mucus and sputum.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: times; letter-spacing: -0.01em; word-spacing: 0.05em;">Like in previous environmental studies, however, these fractions were not the same everywhere and were higher in northern counties.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="background-color: white; box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; letter-spacing: -0.01em; text-align: center; word-spacing: 0.05em;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y7b79jqnnsc/YTayvVXaxXI/AAAAAAAADVY/A_VoClH5qIgjF_DpesqdtXotBk5A7e9FgCLcBGAsYHQ/s662/Vent.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span style="color: black; font-size: medium;">

<p>Early results of the study in MEBO/PATM community, based on the replies of <a href="https://www.aurametrix.com/Blog/Jun2021.html">the first 26 enrollees</a>, showed that while reactions to vaccine were similar to the general population, experiences with COVID-19 infections were not - 2 individuals were not able to avoid the disease in this group, and both of them experienced long term effects.&nbsp;</p><p>As of today, we have stories from 41 members of MEBO/PATM community and 6 different vaccines:&nbsp;AstraZeneca-Oxford, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV, also known as the Sinopharm vaccine.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fbxx-XuRjwI/YN9yRvw6s_I/AAAAAAAADSA/FQ0Pv7w0Cms0gdhMttyBiCsSq9qEbYKpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1150/COVID-VSideEffects.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1150" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fbxx-XuRjwI/YN9yRvw6s_I/AAAAAAAADSA/FQ0Pv7w0Cms0gdhMttyBiCsSq9qEbYKpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/COVID-VSideEffects.png" width="320" /></a></div>Currently, in various areas of the world, 19 COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for use. Statistics on short-term effects of these vaccines have been published for different groups. If we compare our data to published data matching by ages and vaccines, short-term effects are very similar. Some of our sub-groups, especially healthy elderly participants, experienced far fewer side effects than reported in the literature. There were slightly fewer common adverse reactions in MEBO Pfizer group, but incidences of fatigue were on a higher side for all vaccines, and there were more reports of 
fever experienced after Moderna and Astrazeneca, albeit it was not significantly different from the general population. More significant differences were for less common and longer-term effects including fast heartbeat, dry mouth, skin reactions and swollen lymph nodes. The figure below shows common symptoms for Long COVID. Underlined are some of the issues reported after COVID vaccine uptakes in the group. 
Possible worsening of MEBO/PATM symptoms after vaccinations was reported by 10% of study participants.&nbsp;<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nuagYHDfNlQ/YN_CLlAnA1I/AAAAAAAADSQ/Q9VHCkwGK34vHR442lAv7NTWvJ1LAUfDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/LongCovidSymptoms1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nuagYHDfNlQ/YN_CLlAnA1I/AAAAAAAADSQ/Q9VHCkwGK34vHR442lAv7NTWvJ1LAUfDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/LongCovidSymptoms1.png" width="320" /></a></div><span style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">The most significant difference of MEBO group from the general population is the response to COVID-19 infection. 6 people (3 males, 3 females) out of 41 study participants experienced COVID-19 and <b>all of them had long-term reactions</b>. 5 out of 6 considered themselves <b>long-haulers</b>. The 6th person reported persistent MEBO/PATM issues&nbsp; p<span style="text-align: right;">ost-acute COVID-19. That's 80-100</span><span style="text-align: right;">% of long-haulers, ~4 times more than researchers estimate! Our rate is closer to some groups with severe genetic conditions - such as&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: right;">individuals with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia&nbsp; - predisposing to bad smell from nostrils.&nbsp;</span></div></span><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p><span style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">Postinfectious fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom in this group. Long-lasting loss of smell happened in ~16% - as in the general population. 
MEBO/PATM symptoms were significantly increased, unless well under control before the infection. There's anecdotal evidence, based on posts in social media, that some sufferers of chronic COVID-19 are experiencing more aversive underarm smell. 7% of long-haulers are thought to sense phantom distorted smells. Is it really imagined smells or could it be real change in their odor?</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">We also had reports of successful management of persistent COVID symptoms with a low histamine, gluten-free, dairy-free and no carb diets.</div></span></div><br /><p>Why is MEBO/PATM community more susceptible to long COVID? A new study argues that&nbsp;long-haulers might actually be experiencing an attack of fatigue-inducing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, a member of herpesvirus family HHV-4) that was lying dormant in their bodies.&nbsp; For this study, Gold and his colleagues analyzed blood of 30 people with chronic COVID (out of 185 COVID survivors). 20 out of these 30 carried high levels of EBV antibodies. Vaccines were shown to reactivate viruses too, in much rarer cases. As was demonstrated for Pfizer vaccine that woke up another herpes virus, chickenpox herpes-zoster (HHV-3), that causes shingles when reactivated (this happened to 1% of patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases). Herpes simplex (HSV-1) can be also kept in remission by a healthy immune system and can be also reactivated by COVID-19.</p>
<br>
<p>MEBO and PATM symptoms could arise following an infection. Perhaps SARS-CoV-2 can reactivate the old viruses that caused these symptoms to begin with?&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Community immunity (also known as herd immunity) protects everyone. We hope that MEBO/PATM community stays COVID-free and safe.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><div><br /></div><div>REFERENCES</div><div><br /></div><div>Gabashvili IS.

COVID-19 and vaccine reactogenicity
</a>
Adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which can be anticipated and alleviated. A certain level of inflammation is needed to trigger an effective adaptive immune response, but both environment and genetic makeup determine who is more likely to experience particular symptoms after infection and from the vaccine.

Abdominal pain is less widely known as a symptom of COVID-19, 
yet it is&nbsp; - along with shortness of breath and confusion - 
a potential sign of the most severe form of COVID-19. 
In children, having gastrointestinal symptoms 
was more frequently associated with severe and critical phenotype.
