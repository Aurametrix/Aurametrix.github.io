The Invisible Waste
</a>
AI does use real energy and water, but so does the much bigger (and rarely measured) waste of 
forgetting—redoing experiments, rebuilding systems, and repeating mistakes because 
knowledge got lost. If AI becomes a reliable “memory machine” that helps u
s reuse what we already learned, it can trade some compute for a lot less rework, scrap, and emissions.

Healthcare's Knowledge Problem
</a>
Healthcare’s knowledge problem isn’t a lack of information—it’s fragmentation and trust: clinicians spend huge time reassembling scattered records and still must verify every AI-generated detail (“the verification tax”). The real opportunity is AI that turns siloed data into linked, 
auditable summaries—moving from fast drafts to verified knowledge without increasing rework.

The Year AI stopped guessing
</a>
In 2025, AI crossed a critical boundary by shifting from guessing what sounds right to 
verifying what is correct. By combining neural intuition with formal proof systems, 
reasoning became slower, more deliberate, and reliable enough to scale certainty itself.
