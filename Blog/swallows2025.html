<p>In March, when the air was just beginning to warm and the trees had not yet forgotten winter, the first swallows arrived - gliding in over the glassy waters of Tellico Lake, their wings slicing through cold wind and sky. 
These early travelers came from the warm edges of the continent—Florida marshes, the Gulf Coast, and the far inland skies of Mexico—pausing to rest, feed, and gather over water, where insects had begun to stir.</p>
<p>But Keeper and Leaf were not among them.</p><p>
They came later, in April, when the hills around the lake had turned a soft, full green. 
The irises stood on the edge of blooming. The tall oaks and poplars still held their buds tight, 
waiting for one more cue of warmth.</p>
<p>Keeper, swift and attentive, seemed always a wing-length behind his companion. He was watching, guarding, 
holding the rhythm of the flight. 
His mate, graceful and deliberate in her choices, was Leaf, though her name had not yet been spoken aloud.</p>
<p>The pair arrived quietly, circling low over a cluster of birdboxes - tucked not in open roadside fields like those claimed early by bluebirds, 
but hidden behind the houses or along the woodland edge, where moss crept between roots and the light filtered softly through.&nbsp;</p><p>They found the box at the edge of what used to be a maple—now bare and still, but strong in limb, holding firm against time. This was Maple Nest Retreat, though the tree that named it had lost its leaves forever. Even so, it stood tall, offering its arms.</p><p>Keeper and Leaf were circling low above the quiet yard as if listening for a whisper from the land. For a few days, they came and went. Keeper watched. Leaf explored. Then, with a flit and a flick of her wings, she chose it. And Keeper stood watch as the work began.</p><p>Together, they brought threads of life back to the wooden hollow. Bit by bit, they wove it: dried grasses, soft twigs, whispers of the field. But something was missing - something tender, something that would say this nest is home. 
And so, watching from below, a silent helper placed a few small white feathers on the bird feeder - soft plumes of dawn, taken from a couch pillow and placed gently in offering.</p><p>Leaf found them. She lifted them in her beak, carried them inside, and tucked them with elegant care. They curved into the nest like little clouds. And then, something unexpected—she brought a single, dry leaf. Not something swallows are known to do, but she placed it there, cradling it inside the feathers. Was it to cover her future eggs, or simply a symbol of her name, a quiet signature? No one could say.</p><p>Then came the stillness. A pause. As if the world held its breath. Storms rolled in - thunder that shook the ground, rain that carved rivers in the dirt. But the nest held. And one evening, between lightning and the hush of falling rain, the watcher saw them again.</p><p>There they sat - Keeper and Leaf, side by side on a bare maple branch, close to the nest they made. 
Not flying. Not building. Just being. A silhouette of devotion against the grey.</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was only the beginning. But already, it was full of sky.</p>
