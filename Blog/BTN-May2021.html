Hopeful signs continue as the rate of daily Covid infections is declining, 
although the rate of vaccinations is slowing too, and hospitals are seeing more younger adults admitted: 
<a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html">see latest COVIDnet data</a>

It has been over 3 months since our furst participants got both shots and we did not see any 
long-lasting health problems. 

As there will be more large scale unmasked interactions, we'll continue to monitor potential virus 
spread or possible negative health effects. You can tell us about it anonymously.

You can also share your vaccination and COVID-19 experiences with 
our volunteers who will keep your names confidential even from other members of the team.
