was conscious clear but demonstrated psychomotor
slowing and confabulation. Neurological examination
revealed high levels of cortical dysfunction including
poor judgement; disorientation to time, place, and person;
impaired short-term memory; failed abstract thinking;
impaired calculation; and impaired language function (including partial incoherence, agraphia, and anomic
aphasia). The language domains of fluency, reading, and
repetition remained notably intact. No cranial nerve,
motor, sensory, or coordination dysfunction were observed.
Brain computed tomography revealed negative findings
of hemorrhage and structural lesion. While waiting in
the emergency room, the patient experienced a first-time
seizure with a general pattern of a tonic&#8211;clonic seizure.
The patient was prescribed lorazepam and levetiracetam,
and the seizure subsided. The patient presented postictal
confusion and agitation. She was admitted for examination
and treatment.&nbsp;Brain MRI revealed a subacute infarction at the
right internal capsule through diffusion-weighted
imaging (Fig. 1A), and magnetic resonance angiography
revealed an irregularity in vascular contour, indicating
potential vasculopathy, such as vasculitis (Fig. 1B). EEG revealed diffuse background slowing with intermittent low to moderate voltage sharp transients at the right
frontotemporal region.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Qualitative serum tests for paraneoplastic neurologic

and CSF tests for limbic encephalitis, including antiNMDAR, anti-AMPAR1, anti-AMPAR2, anti-GABABR,
anti-LGI1, and anti-CASPR2, were all negative.
 Although autoantibodies were all absent detected,
seronegative autoimmune encephalopathy triggered by
the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination was highly suspected.
In addition to levetiracetam, the doctors initiated steroid pulse
therapy at the start of treatment. The regimen was
methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily for 5 days, which
was subsequently changed to prednisolone 30 mg PO daily
starting from day 6 of admission. The patient&#8217;s symptoms
dramatically improved from day 3 of admission. The
patient was discharged without neurological deficit or
sequelae. One week after discharge, the patient received
repeat EEG, which revealed resolved slow waves without
epileptiform discharges (Fig. 3). Three months later,
repeated brain MRI revealed regressive change of previous
irregularity of vascular contour.
