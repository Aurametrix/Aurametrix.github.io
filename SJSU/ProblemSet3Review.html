<p><font color="#0080C0"><b>Search: </b></font></p>
<p>Exact match, wildcard (*) and multiple term searches are supported.</p>
<p>For wildcard * searches, place a (*) before of after a string, e.g. oxal*.</p>
<p>The following terms can be searched in IPA: Systematic Name, IUPAC Name, CAS 
  Registry Number, Chemical Formula and Brand Name, Entrez gene name, HUGO gene 
  symbol, Affymetrix Expression Probeset IDs, SNP ID, Agilent, Applied Biosystem, 
  Codelink, Entrez Gene (LocusLink), GenBank, GenPept, GI Number, Illumina, International 
  Protein Index, RefSeq, Swiss-Prot Accession, and UniGene.</p>
<p>Searching for terms in more than one category will conduct an AND search operation. 
  For example, if you search for kinases (in the Molecule Types dropdown menu) 
  and invasion, all genes that are kinases involved with invasion are returned. 
  You can restrict your search by adding subcellular location - say, "cytosol", 
  from the subcellular locations </p>

<p><font color="#0080C0"><b>Functional Annotation: </b></font></p>
<p>Easiest way to find what all your molecules have in common is to a list and 
  run functional analysis (right click, or click on options arrow). This will 
  bring a list of categories. Clicking "show functions" will show specific 
  functions and diseases. You can arrange them by p-value to select the most relevant 
  functions and diseases</p>
<p>If your molecules are in the pathway, use overlay tools: Overlay &gt; Functions 
  and Diseases. Use "show functions" or expand categories (+) to see 
  the details. </p>
<p><font color="#0080C0"><b>Exploring pathways:</b></font></p>
<p>Use build tools to connect molecules in pathways, explore path from one molecule 
  to another, add molecules that either regulate, are regulated by, or that physically 
  interact with your molecule. You may specify the molecule types and relationship 
  types that you are most interested in seeing. You may specify whether you want 
  to see upstream, downstream, or both types of interactions. For example, Build 
  &gt; Grow, grow out all molecules that are "upstream", relationship 
  type: "activation" will help you find all kinases that are upstream 
  of a particular transcription factor. Direct interactions appear in the network 
  diagram as a solid line, whereas indirect interactions appear as a dashed line.</p>
<p>Ctrl-W (Help &gt; Workflows &gt; Pathway Workflow instructions)</p>
<p><font color="#0080C0"><b>Upload data:</b></font></p>
<p>New &gt; Upload Dataset, or File &gt; Upload Dataset, or Ctrl-U, or right click 
  on the "Data Set files" under your project<br>
  Browse files on your computer, Select the dataset file and click the Open button. 
  <br>
  During upload, IPA reviews the column headers and selects a format based on 
  its best guess. <br>
  If your identifiers were not in the first column or were not guessed correctly, 
  specify the identifiers by yourself, from the "Select Identifier Type" 
  drop down menu <br>
  Choose the observaion value keeping in mind that automatic cutoffs will be applied, 
  unless your observation is assigned to "other" <br>
  For example, fold change implies that you are not interested in changes less 
  than 1 </p>
<p><font color="#0080C0"><b>Analyze your data:</b></font></p>
<p>Core Analysis allows you to interpret datasets in the context of biological 
  processes, pathways and molecular networks. If you have multiple datasets that 
  represent multiple timepoints or dosage treatments, use Comparison Analysis 
  to understand which biological processes and/or diseases are relevant to each 
  timepoint or dose. </p>
<p>Tox analysis allows you to assess toxicity and safety of compounds of interest 
  early in the development process and rapidly understand the relevant toxicity 
  phenotypes and clinical pathology</p>
<p>You can use Tox Functions and Tox Lists together to help understand and delineate 
  the pharmacological response, mechanism of action, and mechanism of toxicity 
  in liver, kidney, and heart as induced upon drug treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, let's say you are interested in studying Compound A, which will 
  be used to treat a particular condition. You've treated rats at a high-range 
  dose for 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days. You want to know if the rats are exhibiting 
  any side effects indicating hepatotoxicity. After running microarray experiments 
  on the liver, you can use IPA to determine if the molecules that are up- or 
  down-regulated in this liver tissue are involved in functions relating to liver 
  toxicity.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>First look at the Tox Functions results. If tox functions associated with liver 
  have the lowest p-values, this is the organ that will be affected the most. 
  Customize the chart to only look at Hepatotoxicity functions. Here we see that 
  at 1, 3, and 5 days molecules that were affected are involved in liver hepatomegaly. 
  At 3 days, molecules that were affected are involved in liver hepatitis. At 
  5 days, molecules that were affected are involved in liver steatosis. </p>
