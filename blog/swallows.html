The Tufties were gone by mid-May. Fledging was a full-fledged success—every chick had safely left the birdhouse to face the big, wide world. The box was empty and nearly spotless; the tufted titmouse parents had done a stellar job tidying up after their brood.

Soon after, new visitors arrived. A pair of wrens began building a nest atop the old one, and a curious bluebird stopped by to inspect the property. But just as things seemed to be starting anew, the activity came to a sudden halt.
<br>
The reason? Ants.
<br>
Swarms of them had invaded the birdhouse, crawling up through the hollow center of the pole stand and infesting both the old titmouse nest and the new wren construction.

It was time for some bird-lordly intervention.
<br>
I removed the nests—both the Tufties’ and the wrens’—sealed the hollow pole, and scrubbed the birdhouse inside and out with boiling water. Once clean and dry, the house was ready for new tenants.
<br>
The very next day, May 25th, I opened the box to check for any lingering invaders. No ants. Instead, I found a fresh base of dried vegetation—already the foundation for a brand-new nest.
<br>
And that’s where the story of True Blue and Mulan begins.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>

    Soon it became clear who had claimed the birdhouse—a pair of tree swallows. &nbsp;

And here's True Blue, who will&nbsp; be faithfully guarding the nest and his family. 
He'll be always there stationed atop the birdhouse or in the vicinity, to 
make sure wrens won't attempt building their nest again (as they tried, one day - see the picture!) 
and ensure that no intruders disturbed Mulan.

	Around here, tree swallows typically begin nesting in April or early May. 
	So this pair’s mid-May activity sparked curiosity. Were they late bloomers? 
	A young couple who met after their long flight from southern lands? 
	Had they struggled to secure a box earlier in the season? 
	Or perhaps their first nesting attempt had failed.
	
	Whatever their story, one could only hope that this time, everything would go just right.

	The nest was completely finished, topped with lots of geese, duck and gull feathers brought from the lake. Was there something under the feathers? Likely, yes. So I promptly closed the box. The swallows were back later that day. A few days later it was obvious, they had new additions to their family!&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /></div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

It was about 4pm when I finally realized what happened. A prematurely fledged chick was sitting on the rocks unable to fly. Meet Bit. Poor little Bit. He was a healthy little chick and a great hopper, but his tiny little wings were not ready for a flight. I gave him a lift - quickly put him on the palm of my hand and placed the hand next to the opening of the bird house. He promptly hopped into his house. And in a moment True Blue was there feeding the chick!&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

  Next day everything was very quiet. 
  He was gone. Hopefully this time he was more successful. Later as I walked in the garden and made a step towards the bird house from another corner of the yard, Mulan flew towards me, made a few circles around my head as I changed my direction, and went back to her tree. I was not sure why, but thought that little Bit must be OK. She doesn't want me to be near the bird house so I won't go there. Later I realized what was happening. Another chick that also flew prematurely was still on the ground. 3 days later I saw little Bib. The wings were a little larger than Bit's, but Bib 
  seemed to be trapped in a groove. Or was it? &nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><br /></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">They say it's normal for baby chicks to flutter on the ground with parental encouragement before they get airborne. Bib was on the ground for 3 days. It could be still OK, his parents were not abondoning him. As he saw me, he squized into a narrow but deep hole between bricks. Perhaps I was not supposed to do it, but I removed the bricks to take him out. The chick was very weak. I placed him in the palm of my hand, on his feet, and offered him to hop into the birdhouse. But Bib did not seem to want it.</span></p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; border: 0px; color: #666666; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; width: 697.067px;"><tbody style="border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><tr style="border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><th style="border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">July 6 - parents</th><th style="border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">July 6 - parents and a chick</th></tr><tr style="border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><td style="border: 0px; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">

I was standing with the bird in the palm of my hand thinking what to do. Suddenly the chick started flying as his mom, Mulan, dived down flying along his side! Unfortunately, Bib still could not fly up so he landed under the tree, near Chris. Mulan attacked Chris, then flew towards me telling me to leave. And we left. Both parents were flying in the sky guarding the baby. At some point they were joined by another swallow. Was it their oldest chick?</div><div dir="ltr" style="border: 0px; color: #666666; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;" trbidi="on"><br /></div><div dir="ltr" style="border: 0px; color: #666666; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;" trbidi="on"></div>

I saw the family of swallows again next morning. Mulan was fearlessly attacking everythng that was moving around the area.
The baby was flying - a little bit longer stretches of flight but still close to the ground. Both parents were guarding him from above.
A hawk appeared in the sky. Both Mulan and True Blue flew right into the predator! 
Fortunately the hawk had other business to attend to 
and he continued his way. 
The swallows were still near our house arond noon, but then they disappeared. Later that day I saw a 
"stand" of swallows - 
about ten to twelve of them flying South, towards the lake.
<br>
In late summer swallows stream to coastal marshes where they form larger and larger flocks preparing for their long journey.
