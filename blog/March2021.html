Irritable Bowel and COVID-19
</a>:
Abdominal pain is less widely known as a symptom of COVID-19, 
yet it is&nbsp; - along with shortness of breath and confusion - 
a potential sign of the most severe form of COVID-19. 
In children, having gastrointestinal symptoms 
was more frequently associated with severe and critical phenotype.

</a>:
Bad breath in those infected with COVID-19 might be the least of their problems. But studying it helps in understanding the mechanisms of this deadly respiratory disease and developing diagnostic tests. 
<p>
Dozens of confirmed cases of halitosis owing to active infection by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) have been reported in the literature. 
<p>
Several volatile organic compounds in breath have been shown to display significant predictive power for the disease and its severity.
