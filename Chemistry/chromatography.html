<p align="center"><strong>Introduction to Chromatography </strong></p>
<p>Basic Theory</p>
<p>Chromatography is about molecules (organic molecules, usually small, but not atoms or metals!).</p>
<p>5% of all chemical research uses chromatography, 50% of industrial chemistry is chromatography</p>
<p>Definition: The separation of a mixture by passing it in solution or suspension or as a vapor through a medium om which the compoents move at different rates</p>
<p>what's missing? Detection! (and analysis, as separate mixtures are seen at different times<img src="../images/Quizzes_files/Chemistry/chrom.gif" alt="separation of black ink" align="right" /></p>
<p>Paper chromatography - now mostly in undergrad chemistry lab</p>
<p>It was used to separate coloured chemicals or substances, especially pigments.Â </p>
<p>These days in stead of paper we use columns - it gives more volume for separation and mor control over the measurements</p>
<p>3 major parts: pumps and  flow modulators, chromatography column itself, detection system</p>
<p>Gas chromatography </p>

<p>Liquid chromatography is a more complicated system - more pumps, fractiuons collectors</p>
