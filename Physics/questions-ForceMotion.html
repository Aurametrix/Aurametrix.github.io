1. A 5.5 kg block is initially at rest on a frictionless horizontal surface. It is pulled 
with a constant horizontal force of 3.8 N. (a) Calculate its acceleration. (b) How 
long must it be pulled before its speed is 5.2 m/s? (c) How far does it move in 
this time?

<p>2. A charged sphere of mass 3.0x10-4 kg is suspended from a string. An electric 
force acts horizontally on the sphere so that the string makes an angle of 37o
 with 
the vertical when at rest. Find (a) the magnitude of the electric force and (b) the 
tension in the string.

<p>3. A 40 kg girl and an 8.4 kg sled are on the surface of a frozen lake, 15 m apart. By 
means of a rope, the girl exerts a 5.2 N force on the sled, pulling it toward her. (a) 
Calculate the acceleration of the sled. (b) Calculate the acceleration of the girl. 
(c) How far from the girlâ€™s initial position do they meet, presuming a constant 
force? Assume that no frictional forces act.

Two blocks are in contact on a frictionless table. A horizontal force is applied to 
one block, as shown below. (a) If m1 = 2.3 kg, m2 = 1.2 kg, and F = 3.2 N, find 
the force of contact between the two blocks. (b) Show that if the same force F is 
applied to m2 rather than to m1, the force of contact between the blocks is 2.1 N,
which is not the same value derived in (a). Explain.
