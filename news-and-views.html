When we thought COVID-19 was over, as more individuals were vaccinated against the deadly virus, the fourth wave of the pandemic struck, fueling a rise in breakthrough infections.

Community-Based Phenotypic Study of Safety, Tolerability, Reactogenicity and Immunogenicity of Emergency-Use-Authorized Vaccines Against COVID-19 and Viral Shedding Potential of Post-Vaccination Infections: Protocol for an Ambispective study
</a>
Traditional clinical trials as well as citizen science - in its current form, official side effects reporting sites
and social media are all susceptible to biases and misclassifications and do not reach all vaccinated 
individuals. New model suggests a complementary approach.

Viruses and Vaccines.

Many disorders are thought to be post-infectious syndromes. Perhaps SARS-CoV-2 
(and, in rare cases, COVID-19 vaccines) could 
reactivate the old viruses that caused those syndromes to begin with?

COVID-19 and vaccine reactogenicity in MEBO/PATM community.

Adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which can be 
anticipated and alleviated. A certain level of inflammation is needed to trigger an effective adaptive 
immune response, but both environment and genetic makeup determine 
who is more likely to experience 
particular symptoms after infection and from the vaccine.
