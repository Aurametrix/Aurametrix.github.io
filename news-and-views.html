Injuries are most likely to be perceived as "accidents" and "acts of fate", but they depend on the same determinants as other health factors: individual behavior, social and physical environment. The likelihood of injuries - unintentional ones and those caused by acts of violence - can be computed from physical location, gene-environment interactions, prior medical history, and physical traits.</span><br/><br/>October 12, 2010: <a href="https://aurametrix.blogspot.com/2010/10/you-are-chosen-one-at-least-by-your.html">You are the Chosen One, at least by your bacteria</a> <span>Host genomics is not the main decision-making factor for bacteria immigrating into human body, but it is an important factor. Two papers recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences help to understand why you are chosen and how the choosers make their decisions.</span><br/><br/>August 21, 2010: <a href="https://olfactics.aurametrix.com/2010/08/of-blood-and-breath-metabolite-based.html">Of blood and breath: metabolite-based diagnosis of ovarian cancer</a> <span>Physicians always knew that breath contains clues to diseases. Chemicals in breath often correlate with chemicals in saliva and blood - be it alcohol, anaesthetics or other metabolites. Recent paper is claiming 99% to 100% accuracy of detecting ovarian cancer by metabolites in blood.</span><br/><br/>August 15, 2010: <a href="https://aurametrix.blogspot.com/2010/08/predicting-catastrophic-health-events.html">Predicting catastrophic health events</a> <span>"I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours". These were famous words of the almighty computer HAL in "2001: A Space Odyssey". Few of us believe too much in software forecasts - be it weather, earthquakes or computer hard disk failures. Yet, we all know that sometimes it works. And such systems are very valuable, assuming they continuously improve.</span><br/><br/>August 11, 2010: <a href="https://olfactics.aurametrix.com/2010/08/on-cancers-and-petroleum-spills.html">On cancers and petroleum spills</a> <span>Researchers have known for years that smell of cancer patients is chemically different from healthy individuals.

My tall chair is aside. About a year ago I discovered that life is better if I stand while working some of the time. Then I found out that other people discovered it too, and more keep discovering. We hear it often: eat less and exercise. But this may not be enough. As shown in a recent study, exercise does not counteract the ill effects of sedentary lives, we should keep moving throughout the day too.</span><br/><br/>January 13, 2010: <a href="https://aurametrix.blogspot.com/2010/01/counting-health-care-costs.html">Counting Health Care Costs</a> <span>The primary cost in healthcare is unnecessary complexity. Second major contributor to the increase in spending is chronic disease. It actually accounts for 75% of national health expenditures. One of the main reasons for increased disease prevalence is an increase in unhealthy lifestyles.</span><br/></div>

 Things change, but we don't always understand how. Networks and clustering methods help to uncover changes in complex large-scale systems, but more sophisticated approaches are needed to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, between meaningful structural changes and random fluctuations.<br/><br/>November 30, 2009: <a href="https://aurametrix.blogspot.com/2009/11/vitality-and-wellness-era-of.html">Next Generation Healthcare</a> New generation information technologies, computing architectures, real-time data acquisition and processing, and next generation crowdsourcing are revolutionizing health care. Slowly but inevitably we are moving from "Dr. knows Best" to "everybody is a little bit doctor", to next generation diagnostics, better software tools and databases, personal devices, wireless health tools, and new healthcare models.<br/><br/>November 23, 2009: <a href="https://aurametrix.blogspot.com/2009/11/healthcare-is-cost-control-possible.html">Is healthcare cost control possible?</a> Recent mammogram debate shows why reform will fail - most women don't like to get mammograms later in life and less frequently. Of course, this furious reaction is fueled by those who would face payment cuts if the new guidelines are implemented - radiologists, for example. How many medical tests do you need to sleep sound at night knowing that you are healthy enough? Billions, trillions, googols? How many out of a few thousand existing medical tests are redundant or irrelevant to individual consumers?<br/><br/>August 28, 2009:
